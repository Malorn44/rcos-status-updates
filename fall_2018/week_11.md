## Last Week's Accomplishments

Continued last week's research on some new features for the sidebar.

Reviewed the recent usability test we had done and helped come up with changes to make in response to the feedback we got (like the sidebar being a vertical bar instead of just a tiny arrow since the arrow is hard to see).

Found several small bugs that I will begin to address this week.

Updated my fork to the most recent commit (my fork was a bit outdated)

## This Week's Plan

Begin working on some minor bugs that I found.

## Anything Blocking?

Talking to professors and planning alternative plans of study for if I can't get in to my required classes is taking up a lot of my free time.

## Notes

┐(´д`)┌ <--- things are slightly better this week but still trying to get in to required classes.
