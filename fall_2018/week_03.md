## Last Week's Accomplishments

Fixed one issue with screen reader accessibility.
Got YACS *almost* fully running on my computer.

## This Week's Plan

1. Get YACS fully working
2. Finish bug I wasn't able to get to
3. Start on API implementation for YACS admin (maybe)

## Anything Blocking?

Had two major tests this past week so I wasn't able to get all of my goals
for the past week done.
