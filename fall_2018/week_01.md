I completed the "Tour of Heroes" Angular tutorial on the website. I also installed Ubuntu VM and everything needed to get Angular working on my computer.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on fixing two (or more if I have time) issues on YACS-admin. Probably going to assign myself to the two "Show periods" issues if those aren't taken.


## Anything Blocking?

Can't currently assign myself to an issue on GitHub as of yet.
Math Homework. This guy releases hw3 when hw2 isn't done yet :/

## Notes

No extra notes...
