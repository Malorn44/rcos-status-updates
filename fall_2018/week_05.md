## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Worked on implementing the YACS API in typescript.
> Nearly finished implementing it, created files for:
>	school
>	course
>	listing
>	subject
>	term
> One file left to create
> Fixed most of the errors encountered (not yet pushed to the repo. still testing)

## This Week's Plan

> Continue work on YACS API
> Fix all the errors I encountered from last week
> Add associations (https://graphiti-api.github.io/graphiti/js/installation#defining-relationships)

## Anything Blocking?

> Figuring out what some of the errors mean. I have one error that looks like it might be just on my computer that I am trying to figure out.
> Homework 6 for DS is this week and I am tutoring people.
> Quiz this week in Comp Org that I need to do a lot of studying for since I don't feel confident with the material yet

## Notes
