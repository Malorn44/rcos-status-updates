## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Worked on implementing the YACS API in typescript.<br/>
> Nearly finished implementing it, created files for:<br/>
>	* school<br/>
>	* course<br/>
>	* listing<br/>
>	* subject<br/>
>	* term<br/>

> One file left to create<br/>
> Fixed most of the errors encountered (not yet pushed to the repo. still testing)<br/>

## This Week's Plan

> Continue work on YACS API<br/>
> Fix all the errors I encountered from last week<br/>
> Add associations (https://graphiti-api.github.io/graphiti/js/installation#defining-relationships)<br/>

## Anything Blocking?

> Figuring out what some of the errors mean. I have one error that looks like it might be just on my computer that I am trying to figure out.<br/>
> Homework 6 for DS is this week and I am tutoring people.<br/>
> Quiz this week in Comp Org that I need to do a lot of studying for since I don't feel confident with the material yet<br/>
