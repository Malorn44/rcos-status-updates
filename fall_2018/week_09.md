## Last Week's Accomplishments

#### Made changes to the sidebar message from last week.
1. Now uses bootstrap alerts instead of just HTML text
2. Uses a custom CSS class to allow for custom background and text colors
3. Better optimized code for these new changes

#### New message for courses with no description when hovering over sidebar tooltip.
1. When hovering over sidebar tooltip it says "No description available :("
2. Uses bootstrap popover
3. Created a function to return the message if no description or the description if there is one

#### Fixed tooltip description from clipping in to top of browser
1. Uses bootstrap popover
2. Added a "priority queue" using the "auto" feature of the popover as to what direction the popover should open up.

## This Week's Plan

1. Focus on school work and projects for the break.
2. Start researching solution to another issue.
