## Last Week's Accomplishments

Made some small modification to how YACS calcultates the current schedule.

There was an issue where if no courses were selected, the schedule view would default to say you were viewing schedule 1/0.

I modified the code so that it does something slightly different if the schedule length (how many different schedules there are) is 0.

## Semester Overview

This semester has been a really great experience where I got to learn and experiment with new languages and environments that I had never used before.

### New Experiences

This was my first time doing any kind of web development. Some of the languages and frameworks I ended up using are as follows:
- Angular Framework
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

This was also the first time I had fully used a linux operating system (and not just WSL) as well as the first time I *really* used git. </br>
I have used git in the past, but really only for small private repositories.

In additon, this was the first time I have worked on an actual development team, and that was a great experience as well.

### Contributions

This semester, I mainly worked on the front end of YACS. Some of my contributions include:
- Fixing accessibility issues with YACS Admin, our new admin panel we are developing. Prior to this, all I had done was the Angular tutorial on their website. This was my first time putting what I had learned so far into practice.
- Working on the typescript implementation for the new version of the YACS API with Ada. This was my first experience with typescript as most if not all of the accessibility issues I addressed in YACS Admin could be fixed with CSS or HTML tweaks.
- Working on the YACS redesign. This encompassed most of my contributions during the second half of the semester and was the first thing I started working on after finishing with YACS Admin. Most of my contributions involved adding or modifying how certain front-end elements functioned (most notably, the sidebar).

Repositories I've Commited To:
- https://github.com/Malorn44/rcos-status-updates
- https://github.com/Malorn44/yacs/tree/feature/ui-overhaul
- https://github.com/Malorn44/yacs-admin (I also have changes in several branches under this)

### Plans for the future

Being in RCOS this semester was a great experience and I really regret not joining during my Freshman this year.

For next semester, I am planning on staying with the YACS team, except working more on the back-end in Ruby (another new language!).

I also am hoping hoping to become a mentor for next semester so that I can be more involved.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!! :)
