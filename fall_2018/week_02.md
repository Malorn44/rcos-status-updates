## Last Week's Accomplishments

Fixed two accessibility issues with YACS-Admin.
Both issues had to do with buttons (that were non-links) that 
weren't in the tab order for the page and were therefore, not
keyboard accessible.

## This Week's Plan

1. Try and fix 1-2 more accessibility issues.
2. Get YACS running on computer.

## Anything Blocking?

Advanced Calculus Test on Friday so I won't be able to start on any of this until the weekend.

## Notes

Advanced Calc is hard ;(
