## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Addressed my blocker last week of Yacs not working on my machine. 
  - Was resolved by running yacs-build-development and yacs-purge-development a couple of times
- Addressed usability feedback the the sidebar on Yacs wasn't easily noticable.
  - Made the sidebar button expand to almost the full viewport
  - Put a background on the sidebar with curved top-right and bottom-right borders
  - Sidebar has a separate hover color to give user visual feedback of "yes, you can press this"
- Modifications to the sidebar itself
  - Sidebar no longer increases the height of the page, this is accomplished by making the height 100vh instead of 100%
  - Sidebar is made to be sticky so it doesn't scroll with therest of the page and is locked to the viewport
  - Independent scroll wheel for the sidebar that only appears when it overflows
- Created example of a different "Schools" design. Not one that I like, but just to spark discussion.
- Approved a PR to hide main content when it overflows to resolve issue #371

## This Week's Plan

- Work on finishing and releasing Yacs Release 0.12
  - Make sure everyone on the team is staying on top of their issues
  - We only have a few more issues to resolve for Relase 0.12 to be ready for launch
- May possible do one or more of the following:
  - Work on integrating SIS-MAN into Yacs (they took him away from his own site so I must give him a home)
  - Minor sidebar changes (such as better mobile integration). 
  - Helping out with Yacs Admin

## Anything Blocking?

- Need to focus on essays this week as I have less than two weeks before the main part of my 16 page essay is due (and I haven't started it yet... AHHH)
