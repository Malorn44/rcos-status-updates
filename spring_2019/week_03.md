## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Helped out with the #378 issue to add a button for removing courses from the sidebar
  - Helped find where to add code so that we could put a new button on a listing that would only appear on the sidebar by examining how the description tooltip functions.
- Noticed an issue with Yacs Summer
  - We didn't get all the XML files from the Registrar that we needed. Only given courses for the 12-week summer semester
  - We now have the right XML files so Yacs should be up and running for Summer '19 very shortly

## This Week's Plan

- Helping out with Yacs Release 0.12

## Anything Blocking?

- Big essay due next Thursday. I'll be doing not a lot of work this week, more over break.
