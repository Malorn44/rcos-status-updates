## Last Week's Accomplishments

  - Gave some feedback on some current issues that are being worked on. Particularly on a siderbar color scheme to distinguish it from the main content (especially on mobile).
  - Still working on animations. Hopefully will meet with Ada at some time this week to discuss how to improve them.
  - Yacs release 0.12 is still chugging along. Everything should be working now so we just need to review a couple of final changes.

## This Week's Plan

- Working more on animations but mainly just working on general things
- Working on giving a talk/workshop on Qt or something

## Anything Blocking?

I have some slightly more pressing work this week in the form of an Algorithms test. 

In addition, I may have to re-consider my project for one of my classes (worth 25% of my grade) as I don't think I'll be able to get it done within the next 20 days.
