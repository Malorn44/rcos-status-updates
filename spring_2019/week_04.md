## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Made some minor sidebar modifications
  - The scrollbar only appears when it overflows
  - The scrollbar size was made to change to a 'thin' variant if the browser supports it
  - The scrollbar bottom offset was adjusted so as to not cut off the footer message
- Made it so that in schedule view, it shows schedule 0/0 if there are no possible schedules
  - Previously it showed it as 1/0
  - This was achieved by modifying the typescript code used for returning the active schedule
- Modified the main content sidebar to use a 'thin' variant if available

## This Week's Plan

- Helping out with Yacs Release 0.12
- Working on sidebar animations for Yacs Release 0.13
  - This includes an indicator to prompt the user to click the sidebar if they select a new course and the sidebar is closed
  - Also, an animation for when the sidebar is opening 

## Anything Blocking?

- CSS animation is very confusing
- Mobile support is also confusing
- Web dev is confusing :(
