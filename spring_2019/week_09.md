## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Updated the Yacs search to allow for searching for courses by CRN
- Opened a pull request for animations
  - Animations for opening and closing the sidebar. On desktop, it opens like a "drawer". This was accomplished using the "transition" CSS property.
  - Morphing hamburger menu icon on mobile. Morphs from the typical 3 lines into an X when opened to promt the user to click to close.
- Creating several new issues on github for Yacs
  - Issue [#446](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/446) Course tags get in the way of description when expanded
  - Issue [#445](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/445) Noticeable lag when hovering over courses and scrolling
  - Issue [#444](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/444) Last course in the sidebar isn't removed visually when clicking 'X' button
  - Issue [#443](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/443) Too many requests when selecting a course in the sidebar with a lot of sections
  - Issue [#442](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/442) Mobile should have a morphing hamburger menu
- Presented Yacs at accepted students day
- Discussed future changes to Yacs during our weekly meetings, including potentially switching from using flex-boxes on the front-end to using CSS Grid
## This Week's Plan
- Work on requested pull request changes
  - Animations for mobile are going to be turned off, since they don't work very well
  - Hamburger menu library I was using was installed correctly. Need to install it the correct way and re-incorporate the code
- Work on slides for Yacs presentation on Friday
## Anything Blocking?
- Unsure how to do some of the things with proper install of this library. Need to figure that out.
- Final projects coming up that need to get done
