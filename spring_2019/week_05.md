## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Worked on animations for the YACS sidebar
- Re-organized the HTML for yacs to allow for this
  - created a secondary-content-wrapper that encompassed the sidebar toggle button and the sidebar
  - modified how the sidebar is shown by creating a sidebar-close and sidebar-open class
- Added animations
  - sidebar opens like a "drawer" with the sidebar toggle button coming out with the sidebar
    - on mobile the button stays in place to conserve due to a limited screen width
  - animations implemented using "transition" and resizing the sidebar content container
  - fixed an issue with mobile animations where the sidebar was opening from the center of the screen instead of from the left
- modified the sidebar alert so that it doesn't wrap text. Makes the animation look nicer

## This Week's Plan

- There are some issues with the sidebar sizing and some of the animations. Need to...
  - find what is causing the issue
  - find out how to fix the issue
 - Work on getting YACS release 0.12 by helping the team out wherever I can
  - some of the last issues ran into some hitches.

## Anything Blocking?

- I broke YACS on my computer and just got it working agian.
