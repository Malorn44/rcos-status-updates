## Last Week's Accomplishments

> AHH I got this in late :(
- Still messing around with animations. I haven't gotten them to where I want them yet so I haven't committed them.
  - updated my fork to reflect the latest changes to yacs
- Updated the version of Yacs to 0.12 in the repository
  - advised team members
  - attended a 2.5 hour long Yacs video meeting :)
- Getting one step closer to release

## This Week's Plan

- Keep working on my animations.
  - Hopefully I will be able to have a 1-on-1 meeting with Ada this week so we can look at them together
- Maybe geting Yacs 0.12 released???!?!? Hopefully??? I have no idea! :|

## Anything Blocking?

- CSS Animations are hard and I need to figure out what changes I made that screwed with the layout.
  - I need to get the resizing behavior we had prior to my addition of animations while keeping the animations.
