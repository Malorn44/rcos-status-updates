## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Created a mockup design of a new user interface for the YACS sidebar. The current sidebar isn't visible enough, with only a single small arrow alerting people to its existance. The new proposed design is to have a literal side 'bar' that a user can click on.

- Added the 'theme-text-heavy' class to the 'Topics' button in the header. The button was a different appearance from the 'Schedule' button next to it and it looked ugly :(

- Set up times for two weekly YACS meetings, one on Monday and one on Wednesday, so that every member of the team can meet weekly to discuss plans.

## This Week's Plan

- Work on YACS Release 0.12

## Anything Blocking?

- YACS was having some issues working on my machine. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it appeared to be an older version. I need to investigate this.

- I have several tests this week and two essays to write so that is taking up more time than I would like.
