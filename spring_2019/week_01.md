## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Created a mockup design of a new user interface for the YACS sidebar. The current sidebar isn't visible enough, with only a single small arrow alerting people to its existance. The new proposed design is to have a literal side 'bar' that a user can click on.

- Added the 'theme-text-heavy' class to the 'Topics' button in the header. The button was a different appearance from the 'Schedule' button next to it and it looked ugly :(

- Set up times for two weekly YACS meetings, one on Monday and one on Wednesday, so that every member of the team can meet weekly to discuss plans.
