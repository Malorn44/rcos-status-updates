## Last Week's Accomplishments
- Presented Yacs
- Fixed up some more things with my animations pull request (not yet pushed, doesn't work fully yet).

## Semester Overview
This was my second semester in RCOS and I was able to learn a lot new things. This was also my first semester being a mentor, which was a good experience.

As with last semester, I mainly used these following languages/technologies:
- Angular 
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### New Experiences
This semester, I took a leadership roll while working on yacs. It was fun having more of a voice and also helping to delegate issues.
While working on Yacs this semester, I contributed to many talks about how yacs would evolve going forward, from design changes to functionality changes.
Some of these include the planned sidebar redesign, the school view redesign, the schedule view redesign, scheduling classes for summer arch,
and animations for "hamburger" menus on mobile and the sidebar on desktop/mobile.

### Contributions
This semester, I mainly worked on the front end of yacs. Some of my contributions include:
- Added the ability to search by CRN in yacs. This was accomplished by just adding the CRN to the list of things yacs is allowed to query from.
- Modified the sidebar so that it would scroll independently from the main content. Originally, the sidebar would scroll with the main content. This was a big usability issue as whenever someone wanted to look at a course at the top of their sidebar, they would have to scroll all the way to the top of the main content.
- Made the sidebar button more visible. Instead of the small button on desktop, I made the button expand to the full height of the viewport.
- Changed the default schedule number to be "0/0" under the schedule view. This was a change that I made at the end of last semester to an error that I found but it was undone, so I re-added the fix.
- Added animations to the sidebar so that it would slide out like a "drawer". I also added animations to the hamburger menu on mobile so that it is easier to tell when you open and close it. These changes aren't in the main repository yet, but they can be seen on my personal fork.

Repositories I've commited to:

## Plans for the future
Over this summer, I am going to be a mentor once again (possibly for 0 credits just because I want to focus on only mentoring as I won't have a lot of time for contributions).
I am also planning of course to help out yacs as well. We were unfortunately not able to get update 0.12 out this semester, so I hope to help them release that early this summer.
